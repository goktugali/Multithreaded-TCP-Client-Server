A multi-threaded server and a client with dynamic thread pool through System Programming course. The server will 
load a graph from a text file, and use a dynamic pool of threads to handle incoming 
connections. The client(s) will connect to the server and request a path between two 
arbitrary nodes, and the server will provide this service.
